                        The widespread usage of computer systems together with their access to one another through networks and the Internet has resulted in the development of a great deal of computer security flaws. The ever-increasing development of technology and the growing tendency of people depending on computers to do their essential activities are both indications that future security issues may have more significant implications than the events that are occurring right now. The ability to hack and penetrate systems is one of the most useful abilities for building security in cyberspace, and it is also one of the most difficult to acquire. There are many distinct forms of hacking, some of which can be considered ethical while others would be considered immoral. The motivations of the hacker and the ways in which he puts his skills to use may be used as a measure to determine whether or not hacking is ethical. Many people believe that hacking is almost always harmful and wrong, but there are some people who believe that hacking can improve the security of systems as long as hacking does not cause serious harm. Some people say that hacking can improve the security of systems as long as hacking does not cause serious harm.

                            I'm Milad, a Cybersecurity student at UCLan Cyprus. My interest in computer security was sparked after I saw the movie The Social Network, which was directed by David Fincher and released in 2010. Ever since then, I have been constantly pursuing new developments in the field of computer security. I worked in this market for three years inÂ close collaboration with my brother to obtain a taste of the technology business, and the need to create a security perspective enhanced my commitment to seek a master's degree in the field. Enrolling at UCLan Cyprus was like having a wish come true, and everything that's happened thereafter has been nonstop excitement. I would like to express my gratitude to my brother and to Dr. Eliana Stavrou, MSc Cybersecurity course leader, for their constant support and encouragement.
                            <br>
                            In addition to being grateful to my supervisor, I would also want to express my appreciation to Dr. Andreas Savva, who led and directed me down this muddy route. And at the end, I wanna say thank you to Dr. Josephina Antoniou, MSc Computing course leader, and thesis lecturer for all fields that she taught me.
