                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">Social engineering manipulates individuals into divulging secret information. When thieves target people, they generally attempt to mislead them into giving them passwords or bank information or accessing their computers to install malicious software that gives them access to passwords, bank information, and control over their computers. Criminals utilize social engineering because it's simpler to abuse trust than to attack software. It's simpler to get someone's password than to hack it (unless the password is really weak). Social engineering refers to harmful human interactions. It tricks users into making security blunders or handing up important information. Social engineering assaults are multistep. A criminal analyzes the targeted victim to find possible access holes and weak security mechanisms. The attacker gains the victim's confidence to get access to sensitive information or essential resources. Social engineering is harmful because it depends on human mistake, not software and OS weaknesses. Mistakes by normal users are harder to discover and stop than malware-based intrusions.</p>
                            <h2>Social engineering methods</h2>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">Social engineering assaults may happen everywhere humans interact. Five popular digital social engineering attacks are listed below.</p>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">&nbsp;</p>

                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">&nbsp;</p>
                            <h3>Baiting</h3>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">Baiting assaults employ false promises to arouse a victim's greed or interest. They trick people into a trap that takes personal information or installs malware. Worst baiting spreads malware on physical media. Attackers put malware-infected flash drives in obvious places where victims would notice them. The bait is presented as the company's payroll list on a label. Curiosity-driven victims insert the bait onto a company or home computer, which installs malware. Baiting schemes aren't always physical. Baiting involves online adverts that link to harmful sites or entice users to download malware.</p>
                            <h3>Scareware</h3>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">False alerts and bogus dangers are used in scareware. Users are fooled into thinking their system is afflicted with malware, encouraging them to install useless (or malicious) software. Scareware is sometimes called deception software and fraudware. Scareware sometimes appears as legitimate-looking popup advertisements on your browser when browsing the web, showing phrases like "Your computer may be loaded with hazardous spyware programs." It offers to install a malware-infected program for you or directs you to a harmful site. Spam emails that issue fake warnings or offer worthless/harmful services also spread scareware.</p>

                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXcAshytyPY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">&nbsp;</p>
                            <h3>Pretexting</h3>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">An attacker pretexts to get information. A perpetrator typically pretends to require access to the victim to complete a job. The attacker frequently gains the victim's confidence by impersonating co-workers, law, bank, or tax authorities. The pretexter asks queries meant to authenticate the victim's identification to acquire personal information. This scheme gathers SSNs, private contact information, phone data, employee vacation dates, bank details, and even plant security information.</p>
                            <h3>Phishing</h3>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">Phishing schemes use email and SMS messages to create urgency, curiosity, or terror in victims. It coaxes users into providing personal information, clicking on harmful links, or opening malware-infected attachments. An email alerting online service customers of a policy infraction, such as a password change, is an example. It contains links to an illicit website that seems very similar to the real one, urging unwary users to input their identity and new password. The attacker receives form submissions. Since phishing attempts send almost similar messages to all users, mail servers with threat-sharing systems can identify and prevent them more easily.</p>
                            <h3>Spear phishing</h3>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">This targeted phishing fraud targets particular people or businesses. They customize their messages depending on victims' features, jobs, and connections to hide their assault. Spear phishing takes weeks or months to execute. Skillfully done, they're tougher to detect and more successful. An attacker impersonating an organization's IT consultant may send spear phishing emails to workers. It's phrased and signed like the consultant regularly does, misleading recipients. The mail asks users to reset their password and gives a link to a malicious website that grabs their credentials.</p>
                            <h3>Google Dorking</h3>
                            <p class="sub-heading margin-sub-heading text-black">Google dorking, also known as Google hacking, is the practice of supplying improved search results further into Google search in order to hunt for confidential documents on web pages that Google is cacheing as a result of site misconfiguration. These sensitive data include usernames, passwords, log files, and other information. These data are available to the public and may even be downloaded in certain instances.</p>

                                            You must assign an IP address to the cloned site. Leave the <code>IP address for the POST back in Harvester/Tabnabbing</code> as it is or set the desired IP. Then let the script know what website you would like to clone.
